## Blue - Green Deployment


The goal of this project is to practice setting up a blue-green deployment strategy for a simple web application. This will allow you to deploy your application in a more efficient and reliable way.

## Requirement

You are required to take an existing application (e.g. the one you built in [multi-container service project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/multi-container-service)) and setup a blue-green deployment strategy for it. The goal is to deploy the next version of the application in a separate container and switch the traffic to the new container only when the new version is ready.

## Bonus

* Setup a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy the application to the server when the code is pushed to the repository.
* Setup a monitoring system to monitor the application and the deployment process.

---

After finishing this project you will have a good understanding of how to deploy a containerized application in a more efficient way without downtime and with zero data loss.
